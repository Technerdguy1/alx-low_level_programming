Even more pointers, arrays and strings.
 -------------------------------

These tasks were done during **Full Stack Software Engineering Studies** at **Alx_Africa/Holberton School.** 
It aims was to learn about pointers to pointers and how to use them; multidimensional arrays (2D) and how to use them; and lastly standard library functions to manipulate strings in **C Language.**

Technologies
 ------------------------------

- C files are compiled using gcc `9.4.0`
- C files are written according to the C90 standard
Tested on Ubuntu `20.04 LTS` 

Files
 -----------------------------

The following files are scripts and programme written in C:

| Filename | Description
| --- | --- |
| `0-memset.c` | A function that fills memory with a constant byte. |
| `1-memcpy.c` | A function that copies memory area. |
| `2-strchr.c` | A function that locates a character in a string. |
| `3-strspn.c` | A function that gets the length of a prefix substring. |
| `4-strpbrk.c` | A function that searches a string for any of a set of bytes. |
| `5-strstr.c` | A function that locates a substring. |
| `7-print_chessboard.c` | A function that prints the chessboard. |
| `8-print_diagsums.c` | A function that prints the sum of the two diagonals of a square matrix of integers. |
| `100-set_string.c` | A function that sets the value of a pointer to a char. |
| `101-crackme_password` | Create a file that contains the password for the `crackme2` executable. |
