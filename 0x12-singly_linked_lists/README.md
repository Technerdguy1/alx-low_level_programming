Singly linked lists
  ----------------
This project was done during **Software Engineering Studies at alx_africa/holberton_school.** It aims is to learn about:
 - linked lists as a Data Structure in C Language.
- What is Data Structure?                    
 - what is Linked Lists.
 - Types of Linked List
s.                      
- When and why using linked lists vs arrays
 - How to use linked lists.                  
 - Basic Operatios in `Linked Lists:- Insertion, Deletion, Display, search, and Delete`
 - Characteristics of Linked Lists.

Technologies
  -----------------
 - C files are compiled using gcc `9.4.0`
 - C files are written according to the `C90` standard
 - c files were Tested on Ubuntu `20.04 LTS`

Files
  -------------
The following files are programs written in C:
| Filename | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `0-print_list.c` | A function that prints all the elements of a `list_t` list. |
| `1-list_len.c` | A function that returns the number of elements in linked `list_t` list. |
| `2-add_node.c` | A that adds a new node at the beginning of a `list_t` list. |
| `3-add_node_end.c` | A function that adds a new node at the end of a `list_t` list. |
| `4-free_list.c` | A function that frees a `list_t` list. |
| `100-first.c` | Write a function that prints `You're beat! and yet, you must allow,\nI bore my house upon my back!\n` before the `main` function is executed. |
| `101-hello_holberton.asm` |
Write a 64-bit program in assembly that prints`Hello, Holberton,` followed by a new line. |
