0x04.C - More functions, more nested loops
  -------------------
This project was done during **ALX Software Engineering Studies at alx_africa/holberton_school.** It aims is to learn more about functions, and nested loops in **C Language**

Technologies
  -----------------
C files are compiled using;
 - gcc `9.4.0`
 - Tested on Ubuntu `20.04 LTS`

Files
  -----------------
The following are programs written in **C Language**

| Filename | Description |
| ---- | ---- |
| `0-isupper.c` | A function that checks for uppercase character.|
| `1-isdigit.c` | A function that checks for a digit (`0` through `9` ) |
| `2-mul.c` | A funtion that multiplies two integers |
| `3-print_numbers.c`| Prints the numbers, from `0` to `9`. |
| `4-print_most_numbers.c | A function that prints the numbers, from `0` to `9`. |
| `5-more_numbers.c` | Prints 10 times the numbers, from 0 to 14, followed by a new line. |
| `6-print_line.c` | Draws draws a straight line in the terminal. |
| `7-print_diagonal.c` | Draws a diagonal line on the terminal |
| `8-print_square.c` | Prints a square, followed by a new line |
| `9-fizz_buzz.c` | A program that prints the numbers from `1` to `100`, followed by a new line. For multiples of three print `Fizz` instead of the number and for the multiples of five print `Buzz`. |
| `10-print_triangle.c` | Prints a triangle, followed by a new line. | `100-prime_factor.c` | Finds finds and prints the largest prime factor of the number `612852475143` |
| `101-print_number.c` | A function that prints an integer. |
