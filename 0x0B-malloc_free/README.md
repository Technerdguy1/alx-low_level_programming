0x0B. C - malloc, free
  ---------------
These tasks were done during **Full Stack Software Engineering Studies at Alx_Africa/Holberton School.** It aims was to learn about:
 - the difference between automatic and dynamic allocation; 
 - what is malloc and free and how to use them;
 - why and when to use malloc; and 
 - How to use valgrind to check for memory task in **C Language**

Technologies
  ------------------
 - C files are compiled using gcc 9.4.0
 - C files are written according to the C90 standard
 - Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
