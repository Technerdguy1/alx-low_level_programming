Low-level programming & Algorithm
 ---------------------------
Low-level programming and algorithm carried out during Full Stack Software Engineering studies at ALX_Africa/Holberton_School.



Technologies
  ----------------------------
- Scripts written in Bash `5.0.17(1)`
- C files are compiled using `gcc 9.4.0`
- Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- C files are written according to the C90 standard

Projects
  --------------------
  The following are project folders done in the course of the studies:
| Project | Description|
| ---- | ---- |
|[0x00-hello_world](https://github.com/Technerdguy1/alx-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x00-hello_world) | Why C programming is awesom Who invented C; Who are Dennis Ritchie, Brian Kernighan and Linus Torvalds; What happens when you type `gcc main.c`; What is an entry point; What is main; How to print text using `printf, puts and putchar`; How to get the size of a specific type using the unary operator `sizeof`; How to compile using `gcc`; What is the default program name when compiling with `gcc`; What is the official C coding style and how to check your code with `betty-style`; How to find the right header to include in your source code when using a standard library function; How does the main function influence the return value of the program |
| [0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while](https://github.com/Technerdguy1/alx-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while) | To learn about arithmetic operators, relational operators, boolean operators, comments, declaring variables and loops in **C language** |
| [0x02-functions_nested_loops](https://github.com/Technerdguy1/alx-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x02-functions_nested_loops) | This project is aimed at learning about header files, functions, loops and nested loops in **C language** |
| [0x03-debugging](https://github.com/Technerdguy1/alx-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x03-debugging) | To learn how to debug in **C language** |
