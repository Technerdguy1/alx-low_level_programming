Low-level programming & Algorithm
 ---------------------------
Low-level programming and algorithm carried out during Full Stack Software Engineering studies at ALX_Africa/Holberton_School.



Technologies
  ----------------------------
- Scripts written in Bash `5.0.17(1)`
- C files are compiled using `gcc 9.4.0`
- Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- C files are written according to the C90 standard

Projects
  --------------------
  The following are project folders done in the course of the studies:
| Project | Description|
| ---- | ---- |
|[`0x00-hello_world`](https://github.com/Technerdguy1/alx-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x00-hello_world) | This Project was done during **Full Stack Software Engineering studies @ alx africa.** It aims was to learn about what is entry point, basics c commands `(puts, printf, putchar)`,the size of a specific type using the unary operator sizeof, the right header to include when using a standard library function, and compilation process with `gcc` in **C language.** |
| [`0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while`](https://github.com/Technerdguy1/alx-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while) | To learn about arithmetic operators, relational operators, boolean operators, comments, declaring variables and loops in **C language** |
| [`0x02-functions_nested_loops`](https://github.com/Technerdguy1/alx-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x02-functions_nested_loops) | This project is aimed at learning about header files, functions, loops and nested loops in **C language** |
| [0x03-debugging](https://github.com/Technerdguy1/alx-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x03-debugging) | To learn how to debug in **C language** |
| [0x04-more_functions_nested_loops](https://github.com/Technerdguy1/alx-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x04-more_functions_nested_loops) | To learn about nested loops in **C language** |
| [0x05-pointers_arrays_strings](https://github.com/Technerdguy1/alx-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings) | To learn about **Data Structures**:- arrays, pointers and strings and how to use them, differences between pointers and arrays in **C language** |
